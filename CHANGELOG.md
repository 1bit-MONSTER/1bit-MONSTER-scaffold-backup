# Changelog

All notable changes to 1bit.systems. Versioning is **date-based** (`YYYY.MM.DD`),
matching the GitHub release tags (`vYYYY.MM.DD`).

## 2026.08.10 — JARVIS ships NPU-FLM STT + SSE, amdxdna driver regression fixed, eeg-medical archived 🎙️

- **JARVIS: NPU-FLM speech-to-text, SSE streaming, loopback-trusted web UI** (PR #1576).
  STT now goes through FLM's whisper HTTP endpoint (`:8496`), replacing the
  whisper.cpp+ffmpeg fork/exec path; `stream:true` requests are answered as a
  single SSE chunk; long-prompt model selection fixed (was targeting a
  nonexistent `qwen3.5:9b`, now `qwen3:4b`). Same PR also fixes a
  `build_context` double-lock deadlock that had been hanging every
  `/v1/chat/completions` request.
- **amdxdna driver regression found and fixed.** The custom 0.16.0 driver
  build from the wedge-recovery work (below) made the 35B MoE model produce
  garbage on any fresh NPU context — reverting to the kernel's in-tree
  amdxdna **0.7.0** fixes it. Also removed: a `zaya-qwen36.service`
  `Requires=zaya-gpu8b.service` chain that pulled up the whole small-model
  fleet and starved the 35B of NPU columns on start. The 35B and the
  3-small-model fleet are confirmed mutually exclusive on NPU column budget,
  not a context-count cap.
- **NPU firmware RE: verified GEMM via raw ioctls**, entirely outside FLM's
  own binary for the first time — found the correct PDI (Program Device
  Image) offset inside an xclbin's `AIE_PARTITION` section, then ran real
  bit-exact GEMMs on all four of qwen3-0.6b's NPU op shapes (QKV/O/GU/D).
- **`eeg-medical` repository archived.** ZUNA1.1 (the model this project
  ports via `tools/zuna_port.cpp`) already trains on the TUH EEG corpus this
  project had separately been syncing — continuing would have retrained on
  duplicate data toward a duplicate objective, and eeg-medical's README
  claim that "ZUNA1.1 trained on research data, not clinical" is factually
  wrong (TUH is clinical). The ZUNA port stays in this repo as the canonical
  copy; the TUH→B2 sync was stopped ~2 days into a ~17-day run.
- **Ops hardening.** Fixed a watchdog safety net that had never actually
  worked — the kernel package's own modprobe blacklist was silently
  deny-listing `sp5100_tco` at boot; deployed a netconsole capture rig to
  diagnose a separate, still-unresolved intermittent slow clean-shutdown
  stall (not watchdog-related, despite the similarly-named fix below);
  closed a Docker/ufw firewall bypass (`DOCKER-USER` iptables chain — ufw
  doesn't filter Docker-published ports) and an SSH brute-force exposure
  (fail2ban + `ufw limit 22/tcp`).

## 2026.08.10 — ops: reboot.sh watchdog EBUSY fix 🛡️

- **reboot.sh no longer aborts when `/dev/watchdog` is busy.** systemd holds
  the watchdog open (`RuntimeWatchdogSec=60`), so a second open returns EBUSY
  and `set -e` killed the script before `systemctl reboot` ran — leaving a
  wedged NPU box hung with no reboot and no hard reset. When systemd holds
  the watchdog its own runtime watchdog is the hang safety net, so warn and
  continue instead of aborting.

## 2026.08.10 — 35B MoE native path: fused v28 xclbins + FLM multi-turn KV reuse 🧠

- **35B MoE NPU workstream lands native + fused.** All four MOE xclbins rebuilt
  with the v27 multi-row flow (`build_moe_v27.sh`); new **v28 fused**
  `MOE_GUSGU` (routed+shared GU, N=8192+1024) and `MOE_DSD` (K=4096+512, N=2H)
  xclbins cut **4 → 2 launches/layer** — pure concat along N/K in the same
  single-GEMM kernel, opt-in via `NPU_MOE_FUSED`. Fused concat contexts
  (`mgu_f`/`mde_f`), pack routing, block-diagonal DSD zero-init;
  `test_moe_fused_math` verifies v28 against the 4-launch reference (host sim).
- **FLM multi-turn KV reuse.** `npu_flm_delta.h` pure decision fn + backend
  `continue_text()`/delta send — clients resending growing history get no
  `<<RESET>>`/re-prefill; shifted char-token decode detector
  (ASCII+100 / raw+300 / EOS=106) stops FLM output being decoded as garbage
  vocab ids.
- **`zaya-npu.service`** — systemd unit serving 35B MoE via FLM on :8088,
  `LimitMEMLOCK=infinity` (FLM NPU runtime mlocks ~1.5 GB of xclbin buffers;
  the default 8 MB made every mmap EAGAIN).
- **Q4NX pivot stack.** `gguf_to_onebp` emits valid Zaya MoE Q4NX (#1522);
  batch GGUF→Q4NX converter for the model zoo; FLM q4nx-pivot fixes (llama
  tags, config path, probe band); measured format gate + INT8-default routing
  + format policy.
- **JARVIS mobile (Flutter).** Voice gateway: full-duplex WS
  `/v1/voice/session` with token auth, RFC-compliant handshake + parser, VAD
  utterance state machine, `WS_STREAM_BIND` + systemd unit + Strix Halo
  runbook. App: connect/voice screens, state lights, transcript UI,
  offline/reconnect resilience, gateway WS client + audio IO with tests,
  live-gateway simulator E2E.
- **INT8 QDQ converters + one-command zoo conversion.** safetensors→INT8 ONNX
  (attention bias, shards, external data, head_dim from config; Qwen2.5-1.5B /
  7B work), >2 GB ONNX via per-row INT8 embed/lm_head, stream-ordered KV
  writes; `convert_model.py` turns safetensors/gguf → INT8 ONNX + htok +
  config in one command.
- **CI: off the self-hosted runner.** strix-halo runner dependency removed
  (#1555), gh-ops health workflow via gh CLI (#1556), smoke test kills 8099
  port squatters by port; eeg-medical custom domain repaired on Cloudflare
  Pages.
- **Ops: watchdog-armed reboot + amdxdna hardening.** `scripts/reboot.sh`
  arms sp5100_tco (hard reset if the reboot hangs); NPU firmware RE (ws04:
  driver + npu.sbin full map); pool sync hardened against the 7.1.5 amdxdna
  clflush oops; flat `/dev/accelN` layout probed.

## 2026.08.07 — unified control plane: pooled multi-model server + spec decode + Zamba2 Q8_0 🧠

- **Unified model pool wired end to end** (`src/unified_pool.{h,cpp}`, `--pool`):
  every model in the weights dir is mmap'd resident at boot (`.1bp` parsed,
  `.gguf`/`.q4nx` generic); `POST /v1/pool` reports residency; `/v1/models`
  tags pooled models. Measured on strix: **11 slots / ~6 GB resident**, all
  five zoo models served from one process, one OpenAI-compatible API.
- **In-server speculative decoding** (`--draft-model` + `--spec-decode`):
  `Backend` gains `decode_one` / `verify_batch` / `rollback` (ggml-vulkan
  impl); lossless greedy-consistent loop with batched verification and KV
  rollback. Deterministic 3/3 identical outputs; falls back to the normal
  loop when the target backend can't batch-verify. ggml-vulkan `reset()`
  now truly clears the KV per sequence (was a no-op).
- **Zamba2-1.2B-Instruct-v2 Q8_0** (1.84 GB): llama.cpp-fork arch alias +
  kv-name fallback, quantized tensor-exact vs HF checkpoint; chat API
  answers `4.0<|im_end|>`.
- **Model zoo end-to-end** (`scripts/zoo-smoke.sh`, 5/5 PASS): Llama-3.2-1B
  Instruct, Qwen3-0.6B Instruct, Bonsai-1.7B-TQ2, Zamba2 Q8_0, Qwen3-4B
  (NPU FLM) — one command, one server.
- **Spec-decode demo** (`tools/spec_decode.cpp`, `tools/spec_decode_README.md`):
  lossless vs greedy, cross-model draft/target pair.
- Fresh e2e numbers through the unified API in `README.md` (NPU Qwen3-4B
  20.8 tok/s; GGUF 1B ~12.4 tok/s; Zamba2 2.2 tok/s HIP).
- AMD Vitis/Unified SDI 2026.1 toolchain installed on strix
  (`/home/bcloud/Xilinx/2026.1`) for the FPGA-side roadmap.

## 2026.08.04 — memory campaign: leak root-caused + top-1 backend init 🧠

- **#1428 root-caused: not a leak — glibc arena fragmentation.** `FusedBackend::generate()`
  allocated a VOCAB-sized (608 KB) host vector *every token*; freed-but-never-trimmed,
  the blocks trip glibc's dynamic mmap-threshold into the brk arena, interleaving with
  the per-token HIP allocations so top-of-heap never returns to the OS. heaptrack proved
  zero unfreed bytes on the generate path. Buffers are now reusable members: mt=128 creep
  decays 17 MB → 20 kB per 10 reqs and plateaus (~160× less); the `MALLOC_*` env band-aid
  on `1bit-systems.service` was removed.
- **#1427 memory baseline cut ~10 GB.** Dead host f32 weight copies in FusedBackend freed
  after GPU upload/NPU pack (RSS 6768 → 5163 MB); `init_in_order()` now loads the top
  accelerator + one CPU fallback only, everything else inits lazily via the existing
  failover path (instance GTT 8.2 → 2.6 GB). Per-token cross-backend routing was
  KV-incoherent anyway (private KV per backend), so no routing value was lost.
- **Deployed** to `1bit-systems.service` (v2026.08.04 binary), verified: RSS ~5.3 GB flat,
  fused active + cpu fallback, hip_1bp/vulkan lazy.
- **10-bug audit resolved** (#1429–#1438) — SSRF, unkillable-server, OOB/SIGFPE/bad_alloc
  families, loader/backend hardening.
- **Local work artifacts gitignored** (model conv sources, appimage build, heaptrack dumps,
  tool state) — 31 untracked files cleared from status.
- Docs: engineering journey updated through 08-03 (UPDATE 29); packaging manifests synced
  to `2026.08.04` (issue #117 check green).

## 2026.08.03 — ws05 ppl gates + fused prefill chain, RVQ-VAE codec, narrative purge 🧹

- **ws05: per-vocab perplexity gates for every family** (#1243) — ppl gates now
  run for non-Qwen families too, with a truncation guard, single-instance lock,
  and gated-source swaps; partial-tile dequant stride fix + gemma arch aliases.
- **Kernel: fused O→residual→RMSNorm→Gate/Up chain (TQ2_1024)** — decode and
  prefill (M=128) variants cut the post-GEMM tail into one fused pass.
- **Codec: C++ RVQ-VAE decoder + GGUF export** (#1368) — codec now ships in the
  C++ stack with GGUF export support.
- **Narrative purge** (#1412 + follow-up) — stale TheRock-era and Rust-era
  claims removed from docs, CI, hackathon scripts, and packaging docs; proxy,
  agent CLI, and inference engine are all described as C++ now.
- Packaging manifests re-synced to `2026.08.03` (issue #117 check green).

## 2026.08.02 — one ELF to rule them all: every server + CLI in `1bit` 🚀

- **Single binary is now literal** — `build/1bit` embeds zaya_server,
  unified_server, unified_router, **jarvis_server** (TTS/voice, whisper +
  optional onnxruntime codec decoder) and **vision_server** (VL), plus the
  agent CLI: `1bit zaya|unified|router|jarvis|vision|chat|pull|list`.
  Dispatch by subcommand or legacy symlink name (argv[0]); the standalone
  targets still build for dev/CI.
- **`1bit pull` / `1bit list` in pure C++** — model registry + HTTPS download
  via httplib (no curl/bash); replaces the packaged bash launcher.
- **Packaging ships one binary** — deb/tarball stage now contains `usr/bin/1bit`
  + legacy-name symlinks (+ optional `1bit-npu` / `video_lora_vk_cli` sidecars).
  The 296-line bash launcher (`packaging/1bit`) was deleted; `install.sh` no
  longer requires Node.js — it installs the release tarball's single binary.
- Sizes: 67.2 MB raw / 64.4 MB stripped; `site/numbers.json` and the landing
  page bind the real size.
- Voice-clone endpoint now logs honestly: training is an optional Python
  (PyTorch) pipeline; serving/TTS stays pure C++.

## 2026.08.02 — llama.cpp fork synced to b10015-76-g0807d70be + build-hint fix 🔧

- **llama.cpp fork synced** — `third_party/llama.cpp` moved from the paged-KV PR
  head (`329cb3241`) to the documented sync point `0807d70be` (merge of PR #2 +
  873-commit upstream catch-up; +93 commits incl. Vulkan fixes #24362
  (FA mask_opt off on GCN), #25240 (submission threshold for small AMD GPUs),
  #25351/#25432 (SET_ROWS f16)). Rebuilt `-DGGML_VULKAN=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF`,
  Vulkan verified on Strix Halo (Radeon 8060S RADV, KHR_coopmat); `unified_server`
  relinked against the synced statics. Sync record: `docs/llama.cpp-fork.md`.
- **Build-hint fix** — the ggml-vulkan import warning in `CMakeLists.txt` now
  includes `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF`; without it ggml builds shared libs and the
  static import check silently fails even after a successful build.

## 2026.08.01 — Pure-C++ video-lora backend + fresh benchmark sweep + scope guard 🚀

- **Lemonade SDK embedded** — `unified_server` links Lemonade's server core
  (github.com/lemonade-sdk/lemonade, pinned at v11.5.1 in `third_party/lemonade`):
  all 14 Lemonade backends (llamacpp, flm, whispercpp, sd-cpp, kokoro,
  ryzenai-llm, vllm, ...) + the policy-based Router run in-process.
  `unified_server --lemonade` hands off to Lemonade's full server. The NPU
  backend's flm binary comes from the fastflowlm .deb / TheRock dist instead of
  the submodule build (submodule kept as last-resort fallback). `unified_router`
  routes NPU/GPU through Lemonade's RoutingPolicyEngine (deterministic keyword
  classifier; semantic/LLM classifiers are the upgrade path). Vendored-tree
  patches: `CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR` → `CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR` and a PUBLIC
  include-dir propagation on `lemonade-server-core` (both no-ops upstream).

- **TheRock-only builds** — release container no longer ships system ROCm
  (ubuntu:24.04 base; `rocm/dev-ubuntu-24.04:7.2.4-complete` removed) and CI
  never falls back to apt ROCm 7.2.4; all published benchmark claims say
  TheRock 7.15.0a. FastFlowLM .deb (v0.9.46) preferred over submodule build.

- **video-lora pure-C++ Vulkan backend** — `tools/video-lora/vulkan/`: complete
  Vulkan compute engine (conv2d, group_norm, silu, elementwise, attention with
  full softmax, lora_merge) linked into the single `zaya_server` binary. All ops
  GPU-verified vs CPU reference on Radeon 8060S. GLSL compiled at build time
  (glslc or glslangValidator).

- **PR agent hardened** — The-PR-Agent/pr-agent v0.41 (upstream) + DeepSeek +
  GitNexus impact reports; auto-review on every PR open and push; scope guard CI
  (engine + Jarvis) as a required check on main.

- **Fresh benchmark sweep (2026-08-01, Strix Halo / Radeon 8060S, TheRock ROCm 7.15.0a)**:
  - Qwen3-0.6B Q4_K GGML-Vulkan: **373 tok/s** decode (was 337)
  - SmolLM2-135M Q4_K GGML-Vulkan: **662 tok/s** decode (was 598)
  - Prefill INT8 WMMA (I8-APRE): **43.2 TFLOPS** (was 39.4)
  - Prefill 4h variant: 30.4 TFLOPS · TQ1 GEMV: 201 GB/s · Sherry: 157 GB/s
  - zaya_server: 1,578,576 B raw / 1,302,736 B stripped (video-lora linked)

## 2026.07.30 — GGML-Vulkan backend + CI smoke test fixed + stale PRs cleared 🏋️

- **GGML-Vulkan backend** — llama.cpp's Vulkan backend integrated as a new
  inference backend for GGUF/H1B models (MIT). Registered at T2_GPU tier with
  auto-failover → ZINC GPU → CPU.
  - Qwen3-0.6B Q4_K_M: **337 tok/s** (3.0 ms/tok), Init: 335 ms
  - SmolLM2-135M Q4_K_M: **598 tok/s** (1.7 ms/tok), Init: 110 ms
  - Standalone bench: `build/bench_ggml_vk <model.gguf> <tokens> <warmup>`

- **CI smoke test fixed** — 3 root causes resolved after 50+ consecutive failures:
  1. `libhipblas.so.3` not found → auto-detected TheRock SDK lib path at CMake
     configure time, added to `unified_server` RUNPATH
  2. `--model "Llama 3.2 1B Instruct"` didn't match `Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.1bp`
     → hyphens/underscores normalized to spaces before name matching
  3. `npu_flm` always selected as active backend regardless of model format
     → backend selection respects `route.backend_ids_in_order` instead of
       global priority
  4. Models/ directory empty on CI (files git-ignored) → download
     SmolLM2-135M-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf (~104 MB) before server start

- **Backend selection fix** — active backend now chosen from the model route's
  ordered list (not global priority), so GGUF/H1B models route through
  ggml_vulkan first instead of being hijacked by npu_flm.

- **Model name normalization** — `-` and `_` in model names normalized to spaces
  before matching, so `--model "Qwen3 0.6B"` matches filenames like
  `Qwen3-0.6B.Q4_K_M.gguf`.

- **DynamicRouter integration** — ggml_vulkan (BackendType::GENERIC) participates
  in the existing per-token routing infrastructure via FASTEST strategy.

- **Stale PRs cleared** — #1148 closed (superseded), #1138 merged
  (validation-gaps.md restore + GGUF tooling), #1195 merged (1BP build
  pipeline scripts: build_1bp.sh, build_all_1bp.sh, bench_1bp_cpu.cpp).

- **Model catalog** — docs/wiki/models.md restored from base64 corruption (992
  lines of validated performance data). docs/validation-gaps.md restored with
  confirmed bugs + engineering blockers.

- **New tools added:** dump_gguf_meta.cpp, gguf_to_zaya_bins.cpp, run_gguf.cpp
  (minimal CPU inference runner), bench_1bp_cpu.cpp.

## 2026.07.29 — FastFlowLM integration + full benchmark sweep 🏋️

- **ROCm/FastFlowLM submodule added** — official MIT-licensed NPU engine at
  `third_party/FastFlowLM/`. Replaced reverse-engineered `npu_utils` files with
  official copies (bit-identical verifed). NPU kernel binaries now fully free
  for any use, including commercial.
- **16 new kernel benchmarks** measured live on Strix Halo (ROCm HIP): Q1 GEMV
  fused=431 tok/s, TQ2 standard=543 tok/s, Tile8 Zaya1-8B=57 tok/s, TWLA
  int4=3,009 tok/s, Prefill WMMA I8=40.66 TFLOPS, Mamba2 decode=1,293 tok/s,
  KV cache FD L=2048=57.3 GB/s, Sherry GEMV=155 GB/s.
- **Live `llama-bench` results** — 5 model configs across 3 families benchmarked
  on Vulkan ROCm and CPU: Qwen2.5-0.5B up to 15,853/423 tok/s (pp/tg),
  Qwen2.5-1.5B at 5,091/222 tok/s, Qwen3-0.6B at 12,818/273 tok/s.
- **NPU inference validated** — FLM native engine on real XDNA 2 hardware:
  Qwen3-0.6B at 67.5 tok/s sustained decode, 17.6 tok/s first-request.
- **1BP model catalog** — 37 models across 15 families documented with HF links.
  Qwen3-0.6B.1bp (355 MB) and BlackMamba-1.5B.1bp (970 MB) validated on hardware.
- **Green board** — All 19 model families show 🟢 across all 4 backends with
  ✅ validated status.
- **1BP → NPU integration** — `onebp_infer.cpp` ready, needs NPU engine pipeline
  wiring (~50 lines).
- **Zyphra family tracked** — Zaya1-8B 1BP model needs NDK xclbin compilation
  for full NPU support.

---

**Monthly cadence from here.** Next: `v1.1.0` — expected ~2026-08-26.

## 2026.07.24

- **Dense GPU inference through the C++ ZINC Vulkan backend — unlocked.** The
  reverse-engineered ZINC stack now runs dense GGUF transformers (Qwen2/ZR1)
  end-to-end on the Radeon 8060S and matches the CPU reference **token-for-token**
  at **~26 tok/s** (vs ~6 on CPU). Twelve bugs fixed to get there — the last was
  a KV cache sized from `context_length` (131072) that overran RADV's 4 GiB
  `maxStorageBufferRange`, silently zeroing cached-V reads and collapsing
  attention (#844, #847, #851, #852, #854). ZINC is enabled by default for
  the architectures it computes correctly (llama/mistral/qwen2) and falls back
  to `cpu_generic` otherwise (#856); `ZINC_DISABLE=1` forces HIP/CPU.
- **~8.5× faster dense CPU decode.** Parallelized the generic-backend matmul
  with OpenMP — ZR1-1.5B 1.5 → ~12 tok/s, deterministic, output unchanged (#849).
- **Engine crash-hardening.** A backend that fails to initialize (e.g. missing
  Vulkan shaders) now fails over to HIP/CPU instead of taking the server down;
  all backend init/benchmark/generate paths are exception-safe (#846, #847).
- **Security**: image-fetch curl restricted to http/https (SSRF/LFI hardening).
- **Pure-C++ 1BP toolchain, end to end.** Ported the `--tq2` symmetric-ternary
  quant path into `tools/gguf_to_onebp.cpp` (was Q4NX-only) and registered it as
  a first-class CMake target — the advertised `gguf_to_onebp model.gguf out.1bp
  --tq2` is now a real C++ binary, zero Python in the convert path. Verified:
  TQ2 output is exactly half of Q4NX and losslessly round-trips ternary input.
- **Engine health confirmed on-device**: BlackMamba-1.5B at **74.8 tok/s** live
  on Strix Halo (Radeon 8060S, gfx1151), three clean runs, no hangs.
- **Landing page**: new flagship 1BP model showcase (measured perf + direct
  Hugging Face download links) and a second-level **Zyphra** + **Poolside Laguna**
  family showcase. "One binary to rule them all" badge restored.
- **Repo hygiene**: untracked 431 committed `build_cmake/` artifacts + stray
  `Desktop/` that had been polluting every diff; reorganized 50 flat docs into
  `docs/{archive,marketing}/` + a navigation index; README marketing refresh.
- **Compiler warnings cleared** (#827 dead watchdog stores, #828 unused params,
  #829 dead `decode_ternary_word`/`qkv_dim`).

- **Mamba1 GPU backend fully wired and fixed.** `backend_mamba1.cpp` + `mamba1_engine.hip` now compile as a first-class backend in `libbackend_manager.a`. Three critical correctness bugs fixed: conv state buffer overflow (shift loop out-of-bounds write), A_log never exponentiated (SSM scan used raw A_log instead of `A = -exp(A_log)`), and HIP device stub linkage (kernel launches wrapped in `extern "C"` helpers). BlackMamba 1.5B runs at **79.8 tok/s**, BlackMamba 2.8B at **46.4 tok/s** on Strix Halo (ROCm HIP, 15+15 MoE layers alternating). Diagnostic tool `tools/test_mamba1_backend.cpp` added for direct backend testing (#579).
- BlackMamba 1.5B and 2.8B GGUF files converted from HF cache (F16, 438/525 tensors) and benchmarked.

- **FastFlowLM fully reverse-engineered and replaced as the default NPU path.** 22 closed-source `.so` libraries disassembled, 209 xclbin bitstreams traced to their AIE generators, whole stack rebuilt from source (#499, #500). `model_router.cpp` now routes qwen3-architecture models to the native, open-source `npu_xrt` engine first, with the FastFlowLM subprocess kept only as a fallback (#567) — its single-core GEMM kernels are correctness-verified on real hardware (`docs/research/GEMM-KERNEL-CORRECTNESS-CONFIRMED.md`), though throughput is currently lower until the 8-core multi-tile path lands.
- **Model-agnostic engine, broadened further**: GGUF architecture support 2→8 (LLAMA, MISTRAL, QWEN2, GEMMA, PHI, ZAMBA2), quant support 4→13 (Q4_1/Q5_0/Q5_1 legacy + full K-quant family), HIP backend now takes runtime `ModelConfig` instead of hardcoded dims, GGUF parsing consolidated into one shared, verified module (#436, #474, #488, #489, #494).
- **1BP ternary format**: fixed the converter/loader silently dropping norms and MoE expert weights (91% of Zaya1-8B was missing) (#528). TQ2 — real 2-bit symmetric ternary quantization, the format's actual "1-bit" storage path — implemented end-to-end (converter, loader, on-disk layout), verified lossless against source GGUF on a real ternary-trained model.
- **Vision**: Qwen2-VL support, minimal POC — real image-to-text end to end (#491, #492). Lightweight image preprocessing (stb_image, no OpenCV dependency) added.
- **Model catalog**: full Zyphra family showcase (Zamba2, ZR1, Zaya1-74B-preview) plus their 1BP conversions, all uploaded to Hugging Face (#529, #526).
- **NPU toolchain**: switched from Peano/LLVM-AIE to AMD Xilinx IP (Chess) (#527). 8-core INT8 GEMM correctness work reconciled across divergent branches (#344).
- **colibri int4 quantized matmul kernels + PILOT cross-layer prefetch** (#449). **A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol v1.0** support added to `zaya_server` (#345).
- Large correctness/security audit sweeps: ~60 numbered issues closed across #362, #415, #417, #436, #495, #496, #498, plus today's fixes (OSCAR attention cross-warp race, NPU worker pipe I/O timeout, concurrent HTTP handler state race).
- **Landing page**: removed a headline "tok/s" claim that the site's own data-integrity quarantine (`benchmarks/latest.json._unverified`) explicitly flagged as having no source — was still driving `<title>`/meta/OG tags and a JS bug that hardcoded it into the meta description on every load, bypassing the quarantine guard entirely.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-06-26

### Bug fixes & robustness
- `install.sh`: Fixed `$1` unbound-variable crash when running without arguments
  under `set -euo pipefail`
- `env.sh`: Added `$LINK_DIR/build` to `PATH` so CLI tools (`bitnet_decode`,
  `bench_prefill_variants`, etc.) are discoverable after `source env.sh`
- `rust/src/main.rs`: Added `Drop` impl on `AppState` that kills the backend
  child process on server shutdown / panic (no more orphan zombies)
- `h1b_loader.cpp`: Added `f.fail()` checks after every `f.read()` to catch
  truncated or corrupt `.h1b` files early with a clear error message
- `tokenizer.cpp/.h`: [redacted]
  field is the *merged token id*, not the rank; rank is derived from insertion
  order. Added infinite-loop guard in BPE merge loop, empty-input early-return,
  and null-ids validation
- `prefill_dispatcher.cpp`: Added variant-index bounds and null-function-pointer
  checks before dispatch
- `CMakeLists.txt`: Removed `src/ck_gemm.cpp` from the HIP language property set
  (compiled as C++17 via CK's host-only path); removed `src/prefill_dispatcher.cpp`
  from the HIP source set (was duplicating `target_sources` entry)
- `.gitignore`: Removed duplicate `/rust/target` entry; added editor swap files
  and `ck-prefill/build/`
- `prim_kernels.hip`: Added `<cstdlib>` include for `std::abs` / `std::round`
  portability

### Documentation
- `tokenizer.h`: [redacted]
  is `new_id` (merged token id), not `rank`
